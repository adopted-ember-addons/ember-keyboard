### `keyboardPriority`

By default, all activated components are treated as equal. If you have two components that respond to `ctrl+KeyA`, then both will respond when there's a `ctrl+KeyA` event. However, this behavior is undesirable in some scenarios. What if you have a modal open, and you only want it and its child components to respond to key events. You can get this behavior by assigning a higher priority to the modal and its children:

```hbs
noPriorityComponent; // priority defaults to 0
lowPriorityComponent.set('keyboardPriority', 0);

modal.set('keyboardPriority', 1);
modalChild.set('keyboardPriority', 1);
```

In this scenario, when a key is pressed both `modal` and `modalChild` will have a chance to respond to it, while the remaining components will not. Once `modal` and `modalChild` are deactivated or their priority is lowered, then `lowPriorityComponent` and `noPriorityComponent` will be able to respond to key events.

Perhaps more conveniently, this property can be passed in through your template:

```hbs
{{my-component keyboardPriority=1}}
{{my-dynamic-component keyboardPriority=dynamicPriority}}
```

{{key-down-counter parentActivated=keyboardActivated priorityInput=true activatedToggle=true}}
