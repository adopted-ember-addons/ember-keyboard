### Event propagation

By setting `emberKeyboard.propagation` in the `config/environment.js` to `true`,
you're opting into the new event propagation semantics that were introduced in
[issue #63](https://github.com/patience-tema-baron/ember-keyboard/issues/63).

The event propagation is designed to mirror how standard DOM events bubble up
the parent node chain and supports calling a
[`stopPropagation()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation)
and
[`stopImmediatePropagation()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopImmediatePropagation)
on a second event object pased to your handlers.

```js
incrementCounter: on(keyDown('RightArrow'), function(event, ekEvent) {
  const key = getCode(event); // => 'RightArrow'
  // ekEvent.stopPropagation();
  // ekEvent.stopImmediatePropagation();
})
```

Instead of traversing up the parent node chain, `ember-keyboard` walks down the
priority list. This means that all responders with `keyboardFirstResponder` set
to `true` will be called first in descending order of their `keyboardPriority`,
followed by all normal responders in descending order of their `keyboardPriority`.

Calling `stopPropagation()` during the first responder phase will allow all
first responders to get triggered, but will prevent all normal responder to get
triggered.

If you call `stopImmediatePropagation()` during that phase, all following first
responders that have not been triggered yet will be skipped. Event propagation
then continues with the normal responders.

You may call both methods.

Calling `stopPropagation()` during the normal responder phase will allow all
responders of the same priority level to get triggered. Lower priority
responders will not get triggered.

Calling `stopImmediatePropagation()` during that phase will prevent all
responders of the same priority level that have not been triggered yet from
getting triggered. Event propagation then continues with the next lower priority
level responders.

Again, you may call both methods.

Setting `keyboardLaxPriority` will have no effect, since the semantics are
fundamentally incompatible. The major advantage of the new event propagation is,
that higher priority responders get to decide on a per-event basis which events
to 'catch' and which not as opposed to setting or not setting
`keyboardLaxPriority` which either 'catches' no or all events.
