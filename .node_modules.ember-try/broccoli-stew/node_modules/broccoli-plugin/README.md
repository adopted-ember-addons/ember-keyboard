## Example Usage

```js
const Plugin = require('broccoli-plugin');

class MyPlugin extends Plugin {

  constructor(inputNodes, options = {}) {
    super(inputNodes, {
      annotation: options.annotation
      // see `options` in the below README to see a full list of constructor options
    });
  }

  build() {
    // Read files from this.inputPaths, and write files to this.outputPath.
    // Silly example:

    // Read 'foo.txt' from the third input node
    const input = fs.readFileSync(`${this.inputPaths[2]}/foo.txt`);
    const output = someCompiler(input);

    // Write to 'bar.txt' in this node's output
    fs.writeFileSync(`${this.outputPath}/bar.txt`, output);
  }
};
```

## Reference

### `new Plugin(inputNodes, options)`

Call this base class constructor from your subclass constructor.

* `inputNodes`: An array of node objects that this plugin will read from.
  Nodes are usually other plugin instances; they were formerly known as
  "trees".

* `options`

    * `name`: The name of this plugin class. Defaults to `this.constructor.name`.
    * `annotation`: A descriptive annotation. Useful for debugging, to tell
      multiple instances of the same plugin apart.
    * `persistentOutput`: If true, the output directory is not automatically
      emptied between builds.
    * `needsCache` : If `true`, a cache directory is created automatically
      and the path is set at `cachePath`. If `false`, a cache directory is not created
      and `this.cachePath` is `undefined`. Defaults to `true`.
    * `volatile` : If `true`, memoization will not be applied and the build method will
      always be called regardless if the inputNodes have changed. Defaults to `false`.

### `Plugin.prototype.build()`

Override this method in your subclass. It will be called on each (re-)build.

This function will typically access the following read-only properties:

* `this.inputPaths`: An array of paths on disk corresponding to each node in
  `inputNodes`. Your plugin will read files from these paths.

* `this.outputPath`: The path on disk corresponding to this plugin instance
  (this node). Your plugin will write files to this path. This directory is
  emptied by Broccoli before each build, unless the `persistentOutput` options
  is true.

* `this.cachePath`: The path on disk to an auxiliary cache directory. Use this
  to store files that you want preserved between builds. This directory will
  only be deleted when Broccoli exits. If a cache directory is not needed, set
  `needsCache` to `false` when calling `broccoli-plugin` constructor.

All paths stay the same between builds.

To perform asynchronous work, return a promise. The promise's eventual value
is ignored (typically `null`).

To report a compile error, `throw` it or return a rejected promise. Also see
section "Error Objects" below.

### `Plugin.prototype.getCallbackObject()`

Advanced usage only.

Return the object on which Broccoli will call `obj.build()`. Called once after
instantiation. By default, returns `this`. Plugins do not usually need to
override this, but it can be useful for base classes that other plugins in turn
derive from, such as
[broccoli-caching-writer](https://github.com/ember-cli/broccoli-caching-writer).

For example, to intercept `.build()` calls, you might
`return { build: this.buildWrapper.bind(this) }`.
Or, to hand off the plugin implementation to a completely separate object:
`return new MyPluginWorker(this.inputPaths, this.outputPath, this.cachePath)`,
where `MyPluginWorker` provides a `.build` method.

### Error Objects

To help with displaying clear error messages for build errors, error objects
may have the following optional properties in addition to the standard
`message` property:

* `file`: Path of the file in which the error occurred, relative to one of the
  `inputPaths` directories
* `treeDir`: The path that `file` is relative to. Must be an element of
  `this.inputPaths`. (The name `treeDir` is for historical reasons.)
* `line`: Line in which the error occurred (one-indexed)
* `column`: Column in which the error occurred (zero-indexed)
