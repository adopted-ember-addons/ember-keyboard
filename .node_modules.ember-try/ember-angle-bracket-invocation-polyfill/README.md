# ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill

This addon provides a polyfill for angle bracket invocation syntax as described
in [RFC 311](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/311) and [RFC
457](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0457-nested-lookups.html). It's the same
components you know and love, no longer surrounded by mustaches. \o/

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwjblue/ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rwjblue/ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill)

## Installation

```
ember install ember-angle-bracket-invocation-polyfill
```

You will additionally need to ensure ember-cli-htmlbars-inline-precompile is at least version 1.0.3.

## Usage

The best usage guide are the RFCs themselves
([emberjs/rfcs#311](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.html)
[emberjs/rfcs#457](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0457-nested-lookups.html)),
but here are a few examples of "before"/"after" to whet your appetite:

**Before**:

```hbs
{{site-header user=this.user class=(if this.user.isAdmin "admin")}}

{{#super-select selected=this.user.country as |s|}}
  {{#each this.availableCountries as |country|}}
    {{#s.option value=country}}{{country.name}}{{/s.option}}
  {{/each}}
{{/super-select}}
```

**After**:

```hbs
<SiteHeader @user={{this.user}} class={{if this.user.isAdmin "admin"}} />

<SuperSelect @selected={{this.user.country}} as |s|>
  {{#each this.availableCountries as |country|}}
    <s.option @value={{country}}>{{country.name}}</s.option>
  {{/each}}
</SuperSelect>
```

```

- Supports yielding block params from inside the invoked component
