/**
 * An API for writing simple modifiers.
 *
 * This function runs the first time when the element the modifier was applied
 * to is inserted into the DOM, and it *autotracks* while running. Any values
 * that it accesses will be tracked, including the arguments it receives, and if
 * any of them changes, the function will run again.
 *
 * The modifier can also optionally return a *destructor*. The destructor
 * function will be run just before the next update, and when the element is
 * being removed entirely. It should generally clean up the changes that the
 * modifier made in the first place.
 *
 * @param fn The function which defines the modifier.
