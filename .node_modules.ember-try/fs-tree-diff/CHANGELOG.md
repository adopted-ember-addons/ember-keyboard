* [BREAKING] `unlink` and `rmdir` operations are now passed the entry
* [BREAKING] entries must be lexigraphicaly sorted by relative path.  To do this
  implicitly, use `sortAndExpand`.
* [BREAKING] entries must include intermediate directories.  To do this
  implicitly, use `sortAndExpand`.
* reworked implementation to diff via two sorted arrays
* performance improvements
* return entires as-provided, preserving user-specified metadata
* directories in patches always end with a trailing slash
* fixes various issues related to directory state transitions
* directories can now receive `change` patches if user-supplied `meta` has
  property changes
